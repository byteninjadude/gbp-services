                <h3>Photos, Products, Offers & Posts That Convert</h3>
                <p>Regular, high-quality photos tell your business story and build trust with Lafayette customers. We establish a consistent photo cadence that showcases your team, location, products, and services, with special attention to seasonal content that keeps your profile fresh and relevant throughout the year.

For businesses with physical products or menu items, we optimize product sections and structured offers that make it easy for customers to understand what you offer. This visual strategy helps convert profile visitors into customers by giving them a clear picture of what to expect when they visit your Lafayette business.</p>

                    <p>We implement UTM templates that track how customers find and interact with your Google Business Profile. This includes parameters for source, medium, and campaign that help attribute website visits and conversions back to your profile optimization efforts in Lafayette.

For call tracking, we use Google-forwarded numbers that don't compromise your primary business number. This strategy provides clear data on which profile elements drive phone calls while maintaining consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) information across all platforms for your Lafayette location.</p>

These monthly insights drive concrete decisions about what to test or change in your profile strategy. Whether it's adjusting services, adding new photos, or refining your description, every change is data-informed and aligned with what Lafayette searchers actually want.</p>

                    <p>We separate branded searches (where customers already know your business name) from non-branded searches (where they're discovering you for the first time). This distinction helps understand whether our optimization is expanding your reach to new Lafayette customers versus serving existing ones.

Through call tracking and CRM matchback analysis, we identify which customer interactions originated from your Google Business Profile. We're honest about unattributed traffic, clearly labeling what we can't definitively track while providing the most accurate picture possible of your profile's performance.</p>

                <p>For Home Services in Lafayette, we focus on service area optimization, before-and-after project photos, and licensing verification. Common pitfalls include vague service descriptions and inconsistent scheduling information. Review sensitivity requires careful handling of project-specific feedback.

Legal professionals need precise practice area categorization, clear contact protocols, and compliance with advertising regulations. We avoid guarantees or outcome promises in content while highlighting expertise and client service approach. Review management is particularly sensitive given confidentiality concerns.

Health and Wellness providers require careful attribute selection for insurance acceptance, specialty services, and accessibility features. We maintain professional tone while making services accessible to Lafayette patients seeking care. Review responses must balance HIPAA compliance with genuine patient care appreciation.

Restaurants and Retail businesses benefit from menu optimization, current hours and holiday updates, and product feature highlighting. We focus on visual content that showcases your unique atmosphere and offerings to Lafayette customers. Review management addresses specific service or product feedback constructively.</p>
