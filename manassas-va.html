            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="content-block"><p><strong>How long until I see movement in my Google Business Profile performance?</strong><br>Most Manassas businesses see initial improvements within 2-4 weeks as we complete foundational optimizations. Significant traction typically develops over 3-6 months as Google processes changes and gathers new performance data.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Can you guarantee Map Pack rankings for my Manassas business?</strong><br>No ethical provider can guarantee specific rankings due to Google's constantly changing algorithms. We optimize all factors within your control to maximize visibility, but final positioning depends on competition, proximity, and Google's systems.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What access do you need to my Google Business Profile?</strong><br>We require manager-level access to implement optimizations effectively. This allows us to update information, add photos, respond to reviews, and monitor insights while you maintain full ownership and control.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do call tracking numbers hurt my NAP consistency?</strong><br>We use compliant forwarding numbers that don't affect your primary business number consistency. Your main NAP remains unchanged across directories while we track call sources separately.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How do you handle Google Business Profile suspensions?</strong><br>We immediately pause all activity, diagnose the suspension cause, and guide you through Google's reinstatement process. Most suspensions result from guideline violations that we can identify and address systematically.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What if we already rank well in Manassas searches?</strong><br>Even well ranking profiles benefit from ongoing optimization to maintain position, improve conversion rates, and defend against competitor moves. We focus on maximizing the quality of traffic you already receive.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What happens if competitors use spam tactics?</strong><br>We monitor for suspicious activity and file redressals with evidence when we identify guideline violations. While we can't control competitor behavior, we document and report issues to Google for review.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How often should we post on our Google Business Profile?</strong><br>We recommend 2-4 posts weekly for Manassas businesses to maintain engagement and freshness. The exact cadence depends on your industry, seasonal factors, and available content resources.</p></div>
