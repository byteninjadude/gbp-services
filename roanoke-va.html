            <div class="content-block">
                <p>For Home Services in Roanoke, we focus on service area optimization, emergency service attributes, and before/after project photos. Common pitfalls include vague service descriptions and missing license information. Review sensitivity requires careful handling of pricing discussions and project timelines.

Legal practices need precise practice area categories, attorney verification, and professional imagery. Pitfalls often involve improper use of 'legal service' versus specific practice areas. Review management requires strict compliance with professional conduct rules and careful response to client confidentiality concerns.

Health & Wellness providers in Roanoke benefit from practitioner-specific categories, accepted insurance attributes, and appointment booking integration. Common issues include HIPAA compliance in responses and managing patient expectations. Review sensitivity demands careful handling of medical outcomes and treatment discussions.

Restaurants and Retail businesses thrive with menu optimization, product attributes, and seasonal promotion highlighting. Pitfalls include inconsistent hours during Roanoke events and missing holiday specials. Review management requires addressing specific customer experiences while maintaining brand voice.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="content-block"><p><strong>How long until I see movement in my Roanoke visibility?</strong><br>Most businesses see initial improvements within 4-6 weeks as profile completeness increases. Full optimization benefits typically manifest over 3-6 months as Google processes changes and builds trust in your updated profile.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Can you guarantee Map Pack rankings for my Roanoke business?</strong><br>No ethical provider can guarantee specific rankings. Google's algorithm considers many factors beyond profile optimization, including proximity, competition, and user behavior. We focus on maximizing factors within our control.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What access do you need to my Google Business Profile?</strong><br>We require manager-level access to implement optimizations effectively. This allows us to update categories, posts, photos, and attributes while you maintain full ownership and control of the profile.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do call tracking numbers hurt my NAP consistency in Roanoke directories?</strong><br>When implemented properly, call tracking doesn't violate NAP consistency. We use compliant methods that preserve your main business number while tracking GBP-specific calls through secondary numbers.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How do you handle suspended Google Business Profiles?</strong><br>We immediately diagnose the suspension cause, gather required documentation, and submit detailed reinstatement requests. Most Roanoke suspensions resolve within 2-4 weeks with proper evidence and compliance.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What if we already rank well in Roanoke searches?</strong><br>Even well-ranking profiles benefit from optimization. We focus on converting more visibility into actions, improving review management, and protecting your position against competitor moves and algorithm changes.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What happens if competitors use spam tactics?</strong><br>We monitor for spam violations and file official redressals with Google. While we can't control competitor behavior, we document violations systematically and work to level the playing field through legitimate optimization.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do you work with seasonal businesses in Roanoke?</strong><br>Yes, we adapt strategies for seasonal operations like holiday retailers or summer services. We optimize for peak seasons while maintaining appropriate off-season profiles that still capture planning searches.</p></div>
