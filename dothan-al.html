            <div class="content-block">
                <p>A complete, accurate profile that shows up more often in local searches and drives more qualified customer actions. We focus on controlling what we can control: relevance, completeness, and consistency across your business information. Your actual visibility depends on factors like your physical proximity to searchers and local competition in Dothan.

Expect clearer business presentation that helps customers understand your services and location. While we optimize all profile elements Google considers important, we cannot control Google's ranking algorithms directly. Your position in search results will fluctuate based on many factors including how close customers are searching from and what other Dothan businesses are competing for the same searches.</p>

This involves researching local search patterns and understanding how Dothan residents describe services like yours. Proper category selection ensures Google shows your business for relevant queries while avoiding misclassification.

We then map your specific services to appropriate attributes and ensure all available features are enabled. This includes business hours, payment methods, service areas, and other details that help Dothan customers understand what you offer. Attributes are particularly important for mobile searchers who need quick information while on the go in the Dothan area.</p>
