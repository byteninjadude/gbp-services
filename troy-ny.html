            <div class="content-block">
                <p>A complete, accurate Google Business Profile builds trust with potential customers searching for your Troy business. When your profile shows current hours, services, photos, and contact information clearly, people feel confident choosing you over competitors.

Better local visibility comes from controlling what you can: relevance through proper categories, completeness with all business details filled, and consistency across directories. We focus on these factors rather than promising specific rankings, since Google also considers your physical proximity to searchers and local competition in Troy. More qualified actions like calls and bookings naturally follow when your profile accurately represents what you offer.</p>

We analyze your services against what customers actually search for, then select secondary categories that capture additional services without diluting your main focus.

We enable relevant attributes like 'women-led' or 'wheelchair accessible' that help your profile stand out in Troy searches. Each category and attribute maps directly to real search queries people use when looking for businesses like yours in the Troy area.</p>
