Our call tracking strategy uses compliant number forwarding that doesn't violate NAP consistency. We track which profile elements generate phone calls from Upland customers, providing clear insights into what drives real business results.</p>

When attribution isn't clear, we honestly label interactions as unattributed rather than making assumptions. This transparent approach gives Upland business owners a realistic picture of their GBP performance.</p>
