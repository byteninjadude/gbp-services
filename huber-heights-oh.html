            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="content-block"><p><strong>How long until I see movement in my Huber Heights visibility?</strong><br>Most businesses see initial improvements within 4-6 weeks as profile completeness signals register with Google. Sustainable growth typically develops over 3-6 months as engagement metrics and review signals accumulate. Consistency matters more than speed in local SEO.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Can you guarantee Map Pack rankings for my Huber Heights business?</strong><br>No ethical provider can guarantee specific rankings since Google controls final positioning. We guarantee we'll optimize all factors within our control: completeness, accuracy, engagement, and compliance. Your actual ranking depends on competition, proximity, and Google's algorithms.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What access do you need to my Google Business Profile?</strong><br>We require manager-level access to implement optimizations effectively. This allows us to update information, add photos, create posts, and respond to reviews while you maintain full ownership and final approval authority over all changes.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do call tracking numbers hurt my NAP consistency in Huber Heights?</strong><br>When implemented properly, call tracking maintains NAP consistency by using forwarding numbers that don't appear in your business listing. We use methods that preserve your primary business number everywhere it matters for local SEO while still tracking call sources.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How do you handle Google Business Profile suspensions?</strong><br>We immediately pause all activity and conduct a full audit to identify potential guideline violations. Then we prepare a comprehensive reinstatement request with supporting documentation, following Google's official processes while maintaining transparent communication throughout.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What if we already rank well in Huber Heights searches?</strong><br>Even well-ranking profiles benefit from optimization to maintain position, improve conversion rates, and protect against competitor movements. We focus on strengthening what's working while identifying new opportunities you might be missing.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What happens if competitors use spam tactics against us?</strong><br>We document violations systematically and file official redressals with Google. While we can't control competitor actions, we ensure your profile remains compliant and competitive while pursuing legitimate resolution through proper channels.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How often should we post on our Google Business Profile?</strong><br>We recommend 2-4 posts weekly for most Huber Heights businesses, balancing freshness with quality. The exact cadence depends on your industry and available content, but consistency matters more than frequency alone.</p></div>
