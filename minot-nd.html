                    <p>We implement UTM tracking templates that capture exactly how Minot customers find and interact with your Google Business Profile. This shows which searches drive directions requests, website visits, and phone calls from local searchers.

For call tracking, we use compliant number strategies that don't violate NAP consistency while providing detailed call analytics. Implementation includes proper forwarding, recording consent where applicable, and integration with your existing Minot business systems.</p>

We examine call logs, direction requests, and booking patterns to identify opportunities for improvement. These monthly insights drive concrete decisions about photo updates, post content, and attribute optimization specific to Minot market trends.</p>

Call and CRM matchback analysis connects profile interactions to actual customers, while we honestly label unattributed traffic rather than making unsupported claims. This transparent approach gives you realistic understanding of your Minot GBP performance.</p>
