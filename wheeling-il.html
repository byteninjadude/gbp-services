            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="content-block"><p><strong>How long until I see movement in my Wheeling business visibility?</strong><br>Most businesses see initial improvements within 4-6 weeks as profile completeness increases. Sustainable growth in qualified actions typically develops over 3-6 months as consistency builds trust with both customers and Google's systems.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Can you guarantee Map Pack rankings for my Wheeling business?</strong><br>No ethical provider can guarantee specific rankings due to Google's constantly changing algorithms. We focus on factors within our control: complete accurate information, positive engagement signals, and consistent optimization that improves your visibility to nearby customers.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What access do you need to my Google Business Profile?</strong><br>We require manager-level access to implement optimizations effectively. This allows us to update business information, respond to reviews, add photos, and create posts while you maintain full ownership and final approval authority.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do call tracking numbers hurt my NAP consistency?</strong><br>When implemented correctly, call tracking numbers do not harm NAP consistency. We use compliant solutions that preserve your primary business number while tracking calls specifically from your Google Business Profile, maintaining accuracy across all platforms.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How do you handle Google Business Profile suspensions?</strong><br>We immediately pause all activity and conduct a thorough audit to identify suspension causes. Then we prepare detailed reinstatement requests with supporting evidence, following Google's specific guidelines for your situation and business type.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What if my Wheeling business already ranks well?</strong><br>Strong rankings provide an excellent foundation for further optimization. We focus on converting that visibility into more qualified actions, improving customer experience through better information, and protecting your position through consistent maintenance and competitor monitoring.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What happens if competitors use spam tactics?</strong><br>We document clear violations with evidence and file formal redressals with Google. While we cannot control competitor behavior, we ensure your profile maintains ethical best practices that build sustainable visibility and customer trust in the Wheeling market.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How often should we post on our Google Business Profile?</strong><br>We recommend 2-4 posts weekly to maintain engagement without overwhelming followers.
