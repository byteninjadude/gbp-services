We analyze your actual services and map them to Google's category system, ensuring you appear for searches like 'plumber Duluth' or 'restaurant near Canal Park' when appropriate. This strategic categorization forms the foundation of your local visibility.

We also enable relevant attributes that help Duluth customers understand your offerings at a glance, such as 'women-owned,' 'outdoor seating,' or 'wheelchair accessible.' These details help searchers quickly identify businesses that match their specific needs in the Duluth area.</p>

For call tracking, we use compliant methods that don't disrupt your local NAP consistency. Implementation includes proper number placement and integration with your existing systems to capture valuable data about customer inquiries from the Duluth area.</p>

We examine call logs to identify patterns in customer inquiries and conversion quality. This data informs our optimization decisions for the coming month.

Based on these insights, we make strategic adjustments to improve performance for your Duluth business. This might include updating services, refining offers, or enhancing content based on what resonates with local searchers and drives the most valuable actions.</p>

This helps understand whether customers already know you or are discovering you through local search. Call and CRM matchback analysis connects profile interactions to actual customer conversions.

When attribution isn't clear, we use honest labeling rather than making assumptions. This transparent approach gives you realistic understanding of how your Google Business Profile contributes to your Duluth business growth.</p>
