For call tracking, we use compliant methods that don't violate Google's guidelines, ensuring your Sierra Vista business can attribute phone leads back to your GBP efforts without risking profile suspension or ranking penalties.</p>

Through call tracking and CRM matchback analysis, we identify which leads come from GBP efforts. We're honest about unattributed traffic, labeling it clearly in reports rather than claiming credit for all business growth.</p>
