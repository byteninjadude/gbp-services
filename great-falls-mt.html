Full optimization benefits typically manifest over 3-6 months as Google processes changes and accumulates new signals from customer interactions.</p></div>

<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do call tracking numbers hurt my NAP consistency in Great Falls?</strong><br>When implemented correctly using call forwarding, tracking numbers do not violate NAP consistency. We use compliant solutions that preserve your main business number while providing valuable call attribution data.</p></div>
