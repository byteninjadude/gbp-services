Our call tracking strategy uses compliant number implementation that doesn't violate NAP consistency, giving Lacey businesses clear insight into which profile elements generate phone leads. We set up comprehensive tracking that shows exactly how your GBP contributes to business growth.</p>

Through call tracking and CRM matchback analysis, we identify which leads came from your Google Business Profile. We're transparent about unattributed traffic, clearly labeling what we can and cannot track for your Lacey business.</p>
