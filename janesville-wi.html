                <p>A fully optimized Google Business Profile gives Janesville businesses cleaner presentation, stronger local visibility in search results, and more qualified customer actions like calls and direction requests. We focus on controlling what we can control: your profile's relevance, completeness, and consistency across the web, which are factors Google considers when showing local businesses to searchers.

While we optimize these elements thoroughly, we cannot control Google's ranking algorithms directly. Your physical proximity to searchers and local competition in Janesville also influence where you appear in local search results. Our work ensures your profile represents your business accurately and completely when potential customers find you.</p>

                <p>Selecting the right primary and secondary categories is crucial for Janesville businesses because Google uses these to match your business with relevant local searches. We analyze your actual services and map them to Google's approved categories that best represent what customers in Janesville are searching for, ensuring you appear for the right queries.

We also enable relevant attributes that help your profile stand out, such as 'women-led,' 'wheelchair accessible,' or 'offers financing,' giving searchers more reasons to choose your Janesville business over competitors. These attributes appear directly in your listing and can significantly improve click-through rates.</p>

                    <p>We implement UTM parameter templates specifically configured for Janesville businesses to track which marketing efforts drive profile views and actions. This allows for accurate measurement of how different strategies perform in generating local customer engagement.

For call tracking, we use compliant number strategies that don't violate Google's guidelines, ensuring your Janesville business can attribute phone calls directly to your Google Business Profile while maintaining consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) information across all platforms.</p>

We review call logs and customer interaction patterns to understand what drives conversions for your specific Janesville business. These monthly insights inform our optimization decisions, helping us refine your strategy based on actual local customer behavior rather than assumptions.</p>

                    <p>We separate branded searches (customers looking specifically for your Janesville business) from non-branded searches (customers discovering you through service or product queries) to understand true growth in new customer acquisition. This distinction helps measure the effectiveness of your local visibility efforts.

Through call tracking and CRM matchback analysis, we connect profile interactions to actual customer conversions. We honestly label unattributed traffic rather than making assumptions, providing transparent reporting about what we can and cannot definitively attribute to your Google Business Profile optimization efforts.</p>
