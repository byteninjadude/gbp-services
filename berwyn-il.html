            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="content-block"><p><strong>How long until I see movement in my Berwyn business visibility?</strong><br>Most businesses see initial improvements within 4-6 weeks as profile completeness increases. Sustainable growth typically develops over 3-6 months as Google recognizes consistent engagement and local relevance for Berwyn searches.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Can you guarantee Map Pack rankings for my Berwyn business?</strong><br>No ethical provider can guarantee specific rankings. Google's algorithm considers many factors including proximity, relevance, and competition. We optimize what you control - your profile's completeness and accuracy - to maximize visibility to Berwyn customers.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What access do you need to my Google Business Profile?</strong><br>We require manager-level access to optimize all profile sections. Owner-level access is preferred for comprehensive management. We follow strict security protocols and you maintain full control of your account at all times.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do call tracking numbers hurt my NAP consistency in Berwyn?</strong><br>Properly implemented call tracking uses dynamic number insertion that doesn't affect your primary business number in directories. We ensure all tracking methods comply with Google's guidelines for local business information consistency.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How do you handle profile suspensions for Berwyn businesses?</strong><br>We immediately pause all optimization, diagnose the suspension cause, and guide you through Google's reinstatement process. Most suspensions result from guideline violations that we can identify and resolve systematically.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What if my Berwyn business already ranks well locally?</strong><br>Even well-ranking profiles benefit from ongoing optimization to maintain position, improve conversion rates, and protect against competitor activity. We focus on maximizing qualified actions from your existing visibility.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What happens when competitors use spam tactics in Berwyn?</strong><br>We document violations systematically and file redressals with Google. While we can't control competitor behavior, we can protect your profile's integrity and report guideline violations that create unfair advantages.</p></div>
