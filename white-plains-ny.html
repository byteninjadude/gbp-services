            <p class="section-intro">Cleaner, complete profile; stronger local visibility; more qualified actions (calls/directions/bookings). We control relevance, completeness, and consistency, not Google's rankings.</p>
            <div class="content-block">
                <p>A complete, accurate Google Business Profile builds trust with White Plains customers and improves your local visibility. You'll see more qualified actions like phone calls, direction requests, and bookings as your profile becomes more relevant to local searches.

Our optimization focuses on controlling what we can: profile completeness, accuracy, and consistency across platforms. While we can't control Google's ranking algorithm directly, a well-optimized profile performs better in White Plains searches. Remember that your physical proximity to searchers and local competition both influence your visibility, so we work with these factors rather than against them.</p>
