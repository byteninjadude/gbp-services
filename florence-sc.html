            <div class="content-block"><p><strong>How long until I see movement in my Florence business visibility?</strong><br>Most businesses see initial improvements within 2-4 weeks as we complete foundational optimizations. Full impact typically develops over 3 months as Google processes changes and gathers new performance data from Florence customers.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Can you guarantee Map Pack rankings for my Florence business?</strong><br>No ethical provider can guarantee specific rankings since Google's algorithm considers many factors beyond our control.

<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What access do you need to my Google Business Profile?</strong><br>We require manager-level access to implement optimizations effectively. This allows us to update information, add photos, respond to reviews, and monitor performance without compromising your ownership or control.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do call tracking numbers hurt my NAP consistency in Florence?</strong><br>No, we use call tracking solutions that don't affect your primary business number in local directories. Your main NAP remains consistent while we gain valuable insights into GBP-generated calls.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How do you handle Google Business Profile suspensions?</strong><br>We immediately pause all activity and conduct a thorough audit to identify the suspension cause. Then we prepare and submit a detailed reinstatement request with supporting documentation specific to your Florence business operations.</p></div>
