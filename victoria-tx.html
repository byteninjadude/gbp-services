            <div class="content-block"><p><strong>How long until I see movement in my Victoria GBP performance?</strong><br>Most Victoria businesses see initial improvements within 4-6 weeks as profile completeness increases.

Your physical location in Victoria and local competition remain determining factors.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What access do you need to my Google Business Profile?</strong><br>We require manager-level access to implement optimizations while you maintain ownership. This allows us to update categories, attributes, posts, and photos while you control primary administrative functions. We never request owner-level access removal.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do call tracking numbers hurt my NAP consistency in Victoria?</strong><br>We use compliant call tracking that preserves your primary business number for NAP consistency. Tracking numbers are implemented through Google's call system without altering your core business information displayed to Victoria customers.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How do you handle GBP suspensions for Victoria businesses?</strong><br>We immediately diagnose suspension causes, gather required documentation, and submit comprehensive reinstatement requests.

<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What happens if competitors use spam tactics in Victoria?</strong><br>We document violations thoroughly and submit redressal requests with clear evidence.
