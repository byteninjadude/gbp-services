            <p class="section-intro">Cleaner, complete profile; stronger local visibility; more qualified actions (calls/directions/bookings). We control relevance, completeness, and consistency, not Google's rankings.</p>
            <div class="content-block">
                <p>A complete, accurate Google Business Profile builds trust with potential customers searching for your services in Layton. When your profile shows current hours, services, photos, and responds to reviews promptly, you appear more professional and reliable to local searchers.

Better visibility comes from controlling what you can: relevance, completeness, and consistency across your profile and citations. We focus on these factors because Google ultimately controls rankings based on proximity and competition. Even with perfect optimization, your location relative to the searcher and the number of competing businesses in Layton will influence your position.</p>

                <p>Choosing the right primary and secondary categories is critical because they tell Google what your Layton business does. We map your services to real search queries customers use, like "plumber Layton" or "hair salon near me," then select categories that match those intents. This ensures your business appears for relevant local searches.

We also enable appropriate attributes like "women-owned," "wheelchair accessible," or "offers financing" to highlight what makes your Layton business unique. These details help you stand out in search results and attract customers looking for specific features.</p>

We establish a consistent cadence for uploading new images that showcase your team, location, and work, plus seasonal content that keeps your profile fresh and engaging throughout the year.

For restaurants and retailers, we optimize product menus and create structured offers that appear directly in your profile. These visual elements help customers understand what you offer before they even contact you, leading to more qualified inquiries.</p>

For call tracking, we use compliant methods that don't violate NAP consistency, allowing us to attribute phone inquiries directly to your Google Business Profile efforts. This implementation helps demonstrate the real business impact of our optimization work.</p>

We review call logs and action reports to identify patterns and opportunities. These monthly insights drive decisions about what to optimize next, whether it's updating services, adding new photos, or adjusting your posting strategy based on what resonates with local searchers.</p>

Call and CRM matchback analysis connects profile interactions to actual customers and revenue. We honestly label unattributed traffic rather than making inflated claims, giving you a realistic picture of how Google Business Profile contributes to your Layton business growth.</p>

            <div class="content-block"><p><strong>How long until I see movement in my Google Business Profile?</strong><br>Most businesses notice improved profile completeness and engagement within 2-4 weeks. Visibility changes typically take 4-12 weeks as Google processes optimization changes and Layton customers respond to your improved profile.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Can you guarantee Map Pack rankings?</strong><br>No ethical provider can guarantee rankings because Google controls search results. We focus on factors you can control: complete, accurate profiles that maximize your visibility potential within Layton's competitive landscape.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What access do you need to my Google Business Profile?</strong><br>We request manager-level access to optimize all profile sections. You maintain owner access and full control, with visibility into all changes we make on your behalf.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do call tracking numbers hurt my NAP consistency?</strong><br>We use compliant tracking methods that preserve your main business phone number everywhere it appears publicly. Tracking numbers are implemented in ways that don't violate Google's guidelines for Layton businesses.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How do you handle suspended Google Business Profiles?</strong><br>We immediately pause all optimization, diagnose the suspension cause, and guide you through Google's reinstatement process with proper documentation and appeals. Most suspensions require business owner verification.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What if we already rank well in Layton searches?</strong><br>Even well-ranking profiles benefit from optimization to maintain position, improve conversion rates, and protect against competitor advances. We focus on maximizing the value of your existing visibility.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What happens if competitors use spam tactics?</strong><br>We monitor for guideline violations and file redressals with evidence when appropriate.
