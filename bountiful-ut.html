                <p>Selecting the right primary and secondary categories is crucial for appearing in relevant Bountiful searches. We analyze your actual services and map them to Google's category options, ensuring you show up when customers search for what you truly offer. This involves understanding the specific search terms Bountiful residents use and matching your business categories accordingly.

We also enable and optimize all relevant attributes that help your profile stand out. Attributes like 'women-owned,' 'wheelchair accessible,' 'offers financing,' or 'free estimates' can be deciding factors for Bountiful customers comparing local businesses. Proper attribute selection helps qualified customers choose your business over competitors.</p>

Our call tracking strategy uses compliant methods that don't violate NAP consistency, helping you understand which profile interactions lead to phone conversations with Bountiful customers. Implementation focuses on gathering actionable data without compromising your local SEO foundation.</p>

These monthly insights drive concrete decisions about profile optimizations, content updates, and strategy adjustments specific to your Bountiful market. We focus on data-informed changes that improve real business outcomes rather than vanity metrics.</p>

This distinction helps measure how effectively you're attracting new local customers.

Through call and CRM matchback analysis, we connect profile interactions to actual business outcomes. We honestly label unattributed traffic rather than making inflated claims, providing transparent reporting about what we can and cannot track from your Google Business Profile performance.</p>

            <div class="content-block"><p><strong>How long until I see movement in my Bountiful Google Business Profile?</strong><br>Most businesses see initial improvements within 4-8 weeks as we complete foundational optimizations.

<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do call tracking numbers hurt my NAP consistency?</strong><br>When implemented properly, call tracking doesn't violate NAP consistency.

<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How do you handle Google Business Profile suspensions?</strong><br>We immediately identify suspension causes, gather supporting documentation, and follow Google's reinstatement processes.
