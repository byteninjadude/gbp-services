We review call logs and conversion data to identify patterns and opportunities for improvement in your local visibility strategy.

This helps quantify how much new business your Google Business Profile is actually generating versus serving existing customers.

We match call tracking data with your CRM to attribute specific revenue to GBP efforts, while honestly labeling unattributed traffic that may come from other sources. This transparent approach gives you a realistic picture of your Fishers marketing performance without over claiming credit.</p>

<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Can you guarantee Map Pack rankings for my Fishers business?</strong><br>No ethical provider can guarantee specific rankings.

<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do call tracking numbers hurt my NAP consistency in Fishers?</strong><br>Properly implemented call tracking uses number forwarding that preserves your main business number for NAP consistency. Customers always see your primary Fishers phone number while we gather valuable conversion data behind the scenes.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How do you handle Google Business Profile suspensions?</strong><br>We immediately pause all activity and conduct a comprehensive audit to identify the suspension cause.
