Your primary category should match your core business, while secondary categories capture related services people might search for, like 'emergency plumbing' for a plumber or 'same-day delivery' for a retail store.

We then enable relevant attributes that help customers understand what you offer - things like 'wheelchair accessible,' 'women-owned,' or 'curbside pickup.' These attributes appear in search results and help Kentwood customers quickly identify businesses that meet their specific needs.</p>

                <p>We maintain a consistent schedule of high-quality photos showing your Kentwood business, team, and services. Fresh, relevant images build trust with potential customers and show Google that your business is active. For restaurants and retailers, we upload product menus and structured offers that appear directly in search results.

Seasonal content keeps your profile current throughout the year - think holiday specials for Kentwood businesses, summer service promotions, or back-to-school offers. This regular updating signals to both customers and Google that your business is engaged and responsive to local needs.</p>

Our approach focuses on generating organic, authentic feedback from your Kentwood customers rather than incentivized reviews.

We train your team on responding to all reviews with a professional, helpful tone that reflects your business values. For negative reviews, we provide guidance on addressing concerns constructively while maintaining your business reputation in the Kentwood community.</p>

When we find violations, we file detailed redressals with Google including timestamped evidence and documentation. Resolution typically takes 2-4 weeks depending on case complexity, and we maintain communication throughout the process until the issue is resolved.</p>

                    <p>We implement UTM templates that track how Kentwood customers find and interact with your business profile across different channels. This includes source, medium, and campaign parameters that provide clear attribution for profile-driven traffic.

For call tracking, we use Google-forwarded numbers that don't affect your primary business number, maintaining NAP consistency while providing detailed call analytics. Implementation typically takes 1-2 business days once access is granted.</p>

These insights inform our monthly optimization decisions - whether we need to adjust services, update photos, or refine your category selection based on how Kentwood residents are searching for businesses like yours.</p>

                    <p>We separate branded searches (your business name) from non-branded searches (services in Kentwood) to understand true discovery versus existing awareness. Call and CRM matchback helps connect profile interactions to actual customers and revenue.

We honestly label unattributed traffic rather than claiming credit, providing transparent reporting that shows both what we can clearly attribute and what remains part of your overall digital presence.</p>

            <div class="content-block"><p><strong>How long until I see movement in my Kentwood business visibility?</strong><br>Most businesses see initial improvements within 2-4 weeks as profile completeness increases. Sustainable visibility growth typically develops over 3-6 months as consistency signals strengthen and engagement metrics improve.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Can you guarantee Map Pack rankings for my Kentwood business?</strong><br>No ethical provider can guarantee specific rankings since Google controls final positioning.

<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What access do you need to my Google Business Profile?</strong><br>We require manager-level access to implement optimizations, respond to reviews, and post content. Owner-level access is preferred for certain advanced features but not required for most optimization work.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do call tracking numbers hurt my NAP consistency in Kentwood?</strong><br>No, we use Google-forwarded numbers that don't affect your primary business listing. Your main phone number remains consistent across all directories while tracking provides valuable call analytics.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How do you handle Google Business Profile suspensions?</strong><br>We immediately pause all activity and conduct a full compliance audit. Then we prepare and submit a detailed reinstatement request with supporting evidence, typically resolving within 2-4 weeks depending on case complexity.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What if my Kentwood business already ranks well locally?</strong><br>We focus on maintaining your position while improving conversion rates and protecting against competitor movements.
