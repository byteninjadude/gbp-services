            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="content-block"><p><strong>How long until I see movement in my Peachtree Corners visibility?</strong><br>Most businesses see initial improvements within 4-6 weeks as profile completeness increases. Sustainable growth typically develops over 3-6 months as consistency signals strengthen and review velocity builds. Local competition factors affect timing.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Can you guarantee Map Pack rankings for specific keywords?</strong><br>No ethical provider can guarantee rankings since Google controls results. We optimize all factors within your control to maximize visibility. Proximity, relevance, and competition determine final positioning in Peachtree Corners searches.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What access do you need to my Google Business Profile?</strong><br>We require manager-level access to implement optimizations. Owner-level access is preferred for full functionality. We never need personal Google account passwords, using secure invitation workflows instead.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do call tracking numbers hurt my NAP consistency?</strong><br>Properly implemented call tracking uses dynamic number insertion that doesn't affect your primary business number in directories. We ensure NAP consistency is maintained across all platforms while tracking call sources.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>How do you handle profile suspensions?</strong><br>We immediately pause optimization, diagnose suspension causes, and guide you through Google's reinstatement process with documented evidence. Most suspensions stem from guideline violations we help prevent through proper management.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What if we already rank well in Peachtree Corners?</strong><br>Strong rankings require maintenance to defend against competitor advances and algorithm changes. We focus on conversion rate optimization and protecting your position while identifying new growth opportunities.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>What happens when competitors use spam tactics?</strong><br>We document violations and file formal redressals with Google while continuing to optimize your legitimate profile elements. We also identify strategic opportunities that spam-reliant competitors often neglect.</p></div>
<div class="content-block"><p><strong>Do you work with businesses outside Peachtree Corners?</strong><br>While we specialize in Peachtree Corners market knowledge, we serve businesses throughout Gwinnett County and metro Atlanta.
